The goal of this homework is to set up an R data package. The package should contain data, potentially the data you used to create a figure, or data that was part of the reproducible report. The data set should be documented (available as a help file in R). The course notes have been updated with a tutorial-style description on how to get started.

It is not necessary to incorporate tests in your package. Nor is it required that the package is documented beyond `data.R`. However, you may want to explore the capabilities of `testthat` and `packagedown`.

The package should be used in a report or a repository used for data analysis. Do not use the data package repository for the report/analysis.
